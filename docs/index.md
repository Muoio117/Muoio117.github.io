# About Me


I am a self-taught game developer specializating in animation programming within the Unreal Engine. My formal training  is in my **physics** (M.S. Physics) and **engineering** (M.S. Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering). If you're interested in my academic stuff, which is old and quite boring, you may check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hnDQHZQAAAAJ&hl=en) page.

Prior to delving into game development, I leveraged my degree(s) to serve as an adjunct physics professor at multiple colleges: Orange Coast College, Southern California University of Health Sciences, Cypress College, and CSU Stanislaus. However, while pursuing my PhD in physics at UC Merced, I decided to completely change course --- to get out of academia and become a game developer. Was that a stupid decision? Maybe, but I certainly don't regret it. My bank account has a few regrets though.

Since then, I have delved deep into animation-related topics in game development. While I'm certainly no animator, I tried my hand at animation and created the [Unarmed Upright Standing (UUS) Animation Set](https://www.fab.com/listings/af81041b-a12f-418b-af4c-c7cb14be6f95), with the intent of ensuring all states blended well in Blendspace assets. Are the animations pretty? No, not at all. They look more stiff than I do when I run --- and I didn't know that was possible to achieve. But they meet the techincal requirements I aimed for at the start.

Soon afterwards, I created the [Animation Matching Suite](https://www.fab.com/listings/82a3b79c-349f-47e6-89ed-4af3c3c8270b) plugin. The flagship feature was its ability to pose match and distance match Blendspace assets. (The initial release of the plugin was two engine versions prior to Epic's non-experimental introduction of native pose matching.) I never understood why Epic did not (and does not) support Blendspaces for distance matching, so I made the feature myself --- using my UUS Animation Set to test the Blendspace capabilities.

After fiddling around so much with animations, I came to realize I truly dislike the process of animating. I'd rather just press some buttons to make things happen. Since I can't afford Maya, and since I dislike Blender, and since Cascadeur lacks many useful features, I decided to make the [Anim Tools](https://www.fab.com/listings/7608fd4d-4c2c-40be-9a06-274e6f7ef6cc) plugin (previously called MoCap Tools). It handles all the tedious and monotonous tasks I often found myself dealing with. It was also my first time attempting to use Slate. I discovered there is a reason "Slate" rhymes with "hate."

I also started a [devlog](https://youtu.be/Hu_W3mOeC7U). Due to health issues that came up near to when that project began, along with becoming a new father, I had to set that endeavor aside, at least for a time. But the general game development has not slowed.

Anyway...now what am I up to? Well, I'm grinding. I keep learning new things in the hopes I can actually make a living doing what I love: animation programming.
